# Development Workflow

Read these files before changing the project:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
3. `README.md`
4. the relevant component documentation

## Branch and workspace discipline

- `main` is the integration branch.
- Use a feature branch for multi-session or high-risk work.
- Before editing, run `git status --short` and confirm the active branch.
- Worktrees and subagent branches are temporary. Merge verified work into
  `main`, then delete obsolete local branches/worktrees.
- Never use generated files as the source of truth.

## Canonical paths

- Product frontend: `apps/lingualens-app`
- Product API: `apps/api`
- Research ML/audio: `packages`, `src`, `scripts`
- Legacy compatibility only: `src/therapist_backend`,
  `src/clinical_workflow`

Changing these boundaries requires an ADR and updates to
`docs/PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

## Local setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt
```

Frontend dependencies are installed independently:

```bash
cd apps/lingualens-app && npm ci
```

Use Node.js 22.x. Supported Python versions are 3.11–3.13; Python 3.12 is
preferred.

## Run

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd apps/api
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2
cd apps/lingualens-app
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1 npm run dev
```

## Verification

### Focused local verification

Use the maintained focused local project check for repository consistency,
secret scanning, Python imports/core tests/migration smoke, and frontend unit
tests plus a production build:

```bash
bash scripts/check_project.sh
```

It does not run dependency audits, the Python version matrix, frontend lint or
typecheck, the UI design audit, the full Playwright suites, or the benchmark
gate. Do not use it alone as release or deployment evidence.

### Complete CI candidate gates

The complete candidate is the green `Test and Deploy CI/CD` workflow. It adds
dependency audits, Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 coverage, frontend lint/typecheck,
the UI design audit, the full therapist and demo Playwright suites, and the
transcript benchmark plus baseline gate. Pull requests receive those checks;
the backend deployment hook is reserved for a successful push to `main`.

Targeted checks and candidate-lane reproductions:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=apps/api:src pytest tests/test_name.py -q
cd apps/api && PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_workflow.py -q
cd apps/lingualens-app && npm test
# Frontend verification lane
cd apps/lingualens-app && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build
# Focused browser smoke
cd apps/lingualens-app && npx playwright install chromium && npm run e2e:smoke
cd apps/lingualens-app && PLAYWRIGHT_BACKEND_PORT=8001 PLAYWRIGHT_FRONTEND_PORT=3101 npm run e2e:smoke
# Full browser, UI-audit, and benchmark candidate lanes (not run by check_project.sh)
cd apps/lingualens-app && npx playwright test
cd apps/lingualens-app && npx playwright test -c playwright.demo.config.ts
cd apps/lingualens-app && npm run audit:ui
cd apps/lingualens-app && npm run bench:transcript && npm run bench:check
```

### Compose

The default Compose stack starts the frontend, API, and PostgreSQL services.
It intentionally contains no Redis or dedicated worker service. Asynchronous
queue processing is deferred until measurement justifies it and a complete
API-to-worker lifecycle has been separately designed and verified:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Generated and local-only files

Do not commit:

- `.next/`
- `dist/`
- `.local/`
- `node_modules/`
- `*.tsbuildinfo`
- caches, logs, uploaded media, credentials, or private corpus mirrors

Runtime JSON repositories must use anonymized demo records only.

## Documentation and versioning

- Update `README.md` when entry points, setup, architecture, or behavior changes.
- Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for maintained status changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for behavior, dependency, deployment, or meaningful
  maintenance changes.
- Component and schema version tags must be updated when maintained runtime contracts change.
- Use semantic project versions (`v1.6.x`) and Git tags for releases.
- Historical phase/spec/plan documents remain immutable context unless a
  factual correction is required.

## Commit format

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
type(scope): imperative summary
```

AI-authored commits include the required `Co-Authored-By` footer from
`AGENTS.md`.

## Clinical and privacy constraints

- Use anonymized case codes only.
- Do not log transcript/audio content, identifiers, secrets, or storage keys.
- Preserve consent, role, audit, attestation, and report-finalization gates.
- Software verification and Gate 1 results are not clinical validation.
- Thai or mixed-language evidence must fail closed when unsupported.
