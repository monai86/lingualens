# LinguaLens Current Handoff

Last verified: 2026-08-16 (evening)  
Handoff base: `main` at `4771ab0b`  
Working branch: `codex/current-handoff` — carries the completed UI/UX remediation
work described below (see "UI/UX remediation status")

เอกสารนี้เป็น snapshot สำหรับส่งต่องาน ไม่ใช่ architecture authority หากข้อมูล
ขัดกัน ให้ยึด `docs/PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`, `AGENTS.md` และโค้ดบน `main`
ก่อนเสมอ

## Executive summary

LinguaLens มี canonical therapist product เพียงชุดเดียว:

- Next.js frontend: `apps/lingualens-app/`
- FastAPI workflow and clinical-policy API: `apps/api/`
- Supabase: Auth/PostgreSQL/private Storage target
- Scientific/research code: `packages/` และ `src/`
- Analysis-only transcript boundary: `packages/analysis_contract/` และ
  `packages/cha/`

เว็บและ API deploy และตอบสนองได้ แต่ระบบยังเป็น research/education prototype
ไม่ใช่ diagnostic tool และยังไม่ผ่าน production security/legal/Thai clinical
validation gates

Owner feedback ล่าสุดคือ UI ปัจจุบันเข้าใจยาก ดูยาก และใช้งานยาก ดังนั้นงาน
product ถัดไปควรเริ่มจาก UI/UX audit ของ workflow จริงก่อนแก้หน้าจอ ห้ามเริ่มจาก
การ redesign ทั้งระบบ

## Verified deployed state

- Frontend: `https://lingualens-nu.vercel.app`
  - `/` redirects to `/today`
  - `/today` returned HTTP 200 after merge `4771ab0b`
- API: `https://lingualens-api-staging.onrender.com`
  - `/health` returned `{"status":"ok","mock_mode":false}`
- GitHub workflow `Test and Deploy CI/CD`, run `31907613812`: success on
  merge commit `4771ab0b`
- Local `main` was clean and aligned with `origin/main` at handoff creation

Reachability and smoke tests do not prove tenant isolation, production Auth,
private Storage policy, backup, legal, or clinical readiness

## Recently completed work

| PR | Merge commit | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #4 | `af662c97` | Frontend runtime, CI audits, and security alignment |
| #5 | `e5de62fc` | Extraction Phase 1: deterministic CHAT and reviewed-transcript scientific contracts |
| #6 | `538c0944` | Status/source-of-truth cleanup; Redis/Celery no longer treated as an automatic requirement |
| #7 | `4771ab0b` | Extraction Phase 2: synchronous reviewed-transcript execution seam |

Extraction Phase 2 now builds a versioned request, SHA-256 input checksum,
analysis profile, provenance, and result envelope through
`execute_reviewed_transcript_analysis()`. The serialized envelope does not
contain transcript content

It intentionally adds none of the following:

- FastAPI or frontend route wiring
- result persistence or database migration
- Redis, Celery, or background worker
- new ML model or diagnostic output
- UI changes

## Last verification evidence

After rebasing Phase 2 on the status cleanup:

- Python 3.12 core suite: 770 passed, 3 deselected
- analysis contract targeted suite: 18 passed
- API migration smoke: passed through `0012_report_runtime_fields`, 24 tables
- therapist frontend: 412 tests passed
- frontend typecheck: passed
- frontend lint: passed
- Next.js 16.3.1 production build: passed
- repository consistency and secret scan: passed
- GitHub Linux matrix: Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 passed

Known local environment issue: the macOS Python 3.13 environment can segfault in
the existing `numba/librosa` acoustic test. Python 3.12 and GitHub Linux Python
3.13 pass. No audio implementation was changed to hide this platform-specific
issue

## Current architecture boundary

```text
Browser / Next.js
  -> Supabase Auth session
  -> FastAPI /api/v1 for clinical reads, writes, authorization, consent,
     storage mediation, audit, and workflow transitions
       -> PostgreSQL / Supabase
       -> private Storage through server-mediated signed URLs

packages/analysis_contract + packages/cha
  -> deterministic scientific computation only
  -> no auth, CRUD, storage, queue, report finalization, or product API ownership
```

Do not add product endpoints to `src/therapist_backend/` or
`src/clinical_workflow/`. Do not recreate the removed Vite/Capacitor therapist
app

## Important deployment constraint

The current API imports the analysis-only contract from repository-root
`packages/` and the compatibility parser from `src/`. The canonical staging
configuration therefore uses repository root as the Render service root and
declares `PYTHONPATH=apps/api:.:src`; local startup uses the equivalent
`PYTHONPATH=.:../..:../../src` from `apps/api`. This boundary is exercised by
the API import check and the native FastAPI/PostgreSQL smoke check. Docker
Compose remains an optional container-packaging check.

Do not add a `sys.path` hack or duplicate the scientific code inside
`apps/api`. When product wiring is actually required, choose one small explicit
packaging/deployment change and verify API startup on Render before merge

## Recommended next work

### Priority 1: UI/UX audit — COMPLETE (phases A-E implemented)

The read-only audit of the real therapist workflow was completed and ranked
(Critical/High/Medium/Low). The owner approved small testable phases, which were
implemented and verified on `codex/current-handoff`:

- **Phase A**: every silent disabled button on the intake/transcript/findings
  path now explains its own block reason inline (`workflow-gates.ts` + shared
  `aria-describedby` pattern; consumed by `workflow-glossary.ts` terms)
- **Phase B**: "Start session" (Today + Case Detail), the Session nav link, and
  Reports "Find session" links carry `case_id` context (safe-id validated) so
  the therapist is never re-asked to find the case
- **Phase C**: one progress metaphor per page; the pipeline bar reflects the
  actual chosen source path
- **Phase D**: `BottomNav` mounted in `AppShell` for <768px (previously dead
  CSS); `e2e/bottom-nav-responsive.spec.ts` + the previously-broken
  `session-transcript-responsive.spec.ts` are green
- **Phase E**: single `workflow-glossary.ts` applied across intake/transcript/
  findings/report steps ("ML Suggestions" etc. removed)

Follow-ups in the same workstream: report-step glossary, consent consolidation
(shared bilingual `caregiver-consent-form.tsx` replacing the duplicated
CaseDetail/intake surfaces), and server-persisted reviewed-cues acknowledgement
(`POST /sessions/{id}/acknowledge-cues`, migration `0013`; who/when now shown
in the findings view, report provenance, and the clinical PDF's Sign-off &
Audit section).

**Verification**: frontend unit suite 490 passed; API suite 345 passed; eslint
and `tsc --noEmit` clean; default Playwright suite 50/50 and demo-mode config
2/2 on fresh memory backends. Run them with:

```bash
# Default suite (Playwright spawns its own backend + frontend)
cd apps/lingualens-app && npx playwright test
# Demo-mode smoke (dedicated config: NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true server)
cd apps/lingualens-app && npx playwright test -c playwright.demo.config.ts
```

Notes for the next engineer running e2e: if you start the backend yourself,
pass `LINGUALENS_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://127.0.0.1:3100,http://localhost:3100`
and use `PLAYWRIGHT_BACKEND_PORT` (and `E2E_API_BASE_URL` for
`downstream-responsive`) to match its port; benchmarks run only when explicitly
requested (`npx playwright test benchmarks/...`).

### Priority 2: analysis product adapter, only when needed

Status (2026-08-16): the import boundary is still deliberately unresolved.
`apps/api` has no import of `packages/analysis_contract`; the seam itself is
healthy and pure-Python (no numba/librosa; `packages.cha` is parser/roundtrip
only), and its targeted suite passes under Python 3.12. The remaining step is
one small explicit packaging/deployment change (repo root on the API's
`PYTHONPATH` on Render) verified against a real API startup on Render before
any route wiring.

After that boundary is resolved, the smallest next step is an authorized,
consent-gated, therapist-attestation-gated synchronous adapter. It should not
persist results or introduce a queue in its first iteration

Measure runtime before choosing asynchronous execution. If synchronous work is
too slow, use the existing database-backed job model and one worker before
considering a dedicated queue

### Supabase security evidence (deferred by owner; UI assessment now complete)

The owner deferred this while UI usability was assessed; that assessment is now
done (phases A-E above), so this resumes as the gate before real clinical
production use. The local half is verified — the backend tenant-isolation smoke
(`GET /api/v1/organizations/current/tenant-isolation-smoke`, org-admin only)
returns `status=passed` with all application-guard checks green — but the
staging evidence itself cannot be produced locally. It requires the real
staging Supabase project and staging API deployment, exactly as
`docs/STAGING_TENANT_SAFETY_VERIFICATION.md` specifies (local mock results are
explicitly not a substitute):

- real-claim two-organization RLS verification
- JWT/JWKS and custom-claim verification
- invitation and TOTP MFA lifecycle verification
- private Storage, signed URL expiry, completion, and retention verification
- secret rotation, backup/restore, observability, privacy/legal/vendor approval

Follow `docs/PHASE1_EXTERNAL_BLOCKERS.md` and
`docs/STAGING_TENANT_SAFETY_VERIFICATION.md` when this work resumes.
Staging credentials/environment are not available in this local checkout.

## Do not do next

- Do not merge `codex/v1.7.0-speech-to-chat` wholesale
- Do not drop the recovery stash without explicit owner approval
- Do not add Redis/Celery because it appears in historical deployment docs
- Do not add realtime, GraphQL, Kubernetes, vector databases, LLM/RAG, or new ML
- Do not move ordinary CRUD or clinical workflow policy into the analysis layer
- Do not weaken non-diagnostic wording or therapist review gates for UI clarity

## Preserved recovery state

- Worktree: `.worktrees/v1.7.0-speech-to-chat`
- Branch: `codex/v1.7.0-speech-to-chat`
- Recovery stash: `stash@{0}: phase1-recovery-2026-08-15-before-main-cleanup`

The old speech-to-CHAT branch is large and contains over-scoped product/queue
work. Reuse only reviewed pieces through small extractions; do not merge the
branch as a unit

## Environment and secret handling

Expected frontend variable names include:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Backend configuration uses the `LINGUALENS_*` names documented in
`apps/api/README.md` and the deployment runbooks. Never place values, bearer
tokens, service-role keys, database passwords, child identifiers, transcript
text, audio content, storage keys, or raw clinical URLs in commits, fixtures,
handoff notes, logs, or issue trackers

## Copy/paste continuation brief

```text
Read AGENTS.md, docs/PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md, and docs/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md.
Start with a read-only UI/UX audit of the maintained Next.js therapist app.
Use the live workflow and current code, rank usability problems, propose the
smallest reviewable phases, and stop for approval before changing UI code.
Do not modify the deferred Supabase security configuration, scientific
analysis behavior, legacy research surfaces, or clinical safety gates.
```
