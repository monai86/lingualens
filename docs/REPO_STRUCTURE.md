# Repository Structure

Use [`PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`](./PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md) as the
authoritative runtime boundary. This file is the quick structural map for the
current repository layout.

## Active product surfaces

- `apps/lingualens-app/` — canonical therapist frontend (Next.js)
- `apps/api/` — canonical therapist workflow API (FastAPI)

## Shared and research libraries

- `shared/` — shared frontend-safe JavaScript models/services used by the Vite
  surfaces
- `packages/cha/` — CHAT parser
- `packages/features/` — canonical transcript feature extraction
- `packages/ml/` — reference-evidence ML contracts, artifacts, and inference
- `src/audio_pipeline/` — experimental audio-to-CHAT pipeline
- `src/clinical_speech/` — normalization and clinical speech utilities
- `src/` top-level scripts — active research entrypoints that remain outside
  the maintained product runtime

## Legacy compatibility surfaces

- `src/therapist_backend/` — legacy pilot API retained for research tests
- `src/clinical_workflow/` — legacy repository/domain layer retained for
  compatibility

Do not add new product behavior to these legacy paths.

## Removed non-current surfaces

- `public-screening/` — removed educational demo
- `presentation-dashboard/` — removed advisor/demo dashboard
- `src/classifier.py`, `src/deep_learning.py` — removed legacy benchmark pipelines

## Data and artifacts

- `data/` — corpora, curated/reference data, evaluation inputs, and local demo
  uploads
- `artifacts/` — promoted or candidate model/reference artifacts
- `reports/` — generated figures, metrics, and progress-report outputs

## Documentation and operations

- `docs/` — maintained product, architecture, safety, and research docs
- `scripts/` — verification, artifact generation, and reproducible research
  helpers
- `tests/` — research/runtime regression tests
- `apps/api/tests/` — API-focused tests for the active therapist backend

## Root-level documentation and clinical guidelines

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — AI agent guardrails, rules, and canonical source-of-truth pointers
- `README.md` / `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — project introduction, architecture overview, and maintained status
- `CHANGELOG.md` — version release notes and system changes
- `DEVELOPER_SETUP.md` — local development onboarding and environment instructions
- `CONTEXT.md` — project glossary and clinical terminology reference
- `PRODUCT.md` — product personality, clinical teal design principles, and UI tokens
- `CLINICAL_GUIDELINE_MAPPING.md` & `clinical-guidelines/` — clinical construct mappings and raw guidelines (ASHA, NICE, DSPM)
- `REPORT_SPECIFICATION.md` — clinical progress report requirements and guardrails
- `THERAPIST_SIMPLE_WORKFLOW.md` & `SCOPE_AND_DELIVERABLES.md` — therapist workflow specs and deliverables
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` — prototype constraints and clinical safety boundaries

## Desktop and terminal launchers

- `lingualens` / `run_gui.sh` — launcher for LinguaLens Desktop GUI (`scripts/lingualens_gui.py`)
- `run_tui.sh` — launcher for LinguaLens Terminal TUI (`scripts/lingualens_tui.py`)
