## ⚠️ Clinical Safety Boundary & Prototype Status

This project is a **research prototype and educational demo**. It supports screening support, concern level estimation, and progress tracking only. It does not diagnose ASD and does not replace clinician judgment. The model was trained on English-speaking public corpora and is **not validated for Thai children**.

### Prototype Status & Limitations
- **Persistent Therapist Workflow**: lingualens persists case, session,
  transcript, QA, attestation, feature, and report records through `apps/api`.
  Local API development defaults to durable JSON storage; browser session
  storage is only a lightweight UI/navigation cache and never stores audio
  bytes.
- **Repository Modes**: `json` is the default usable-prototype mode and
  survives API restarts. `memory` is for isolated tests or intentional demo
  resets. `sql` now includes local pilot plus Phase 1 tenant/RLS foundation,
  but still is not full production hardening.
- **Offline Boundary**: When the API is unreachable, the therapist app shows
  local workspace mode. Safe demo input remains available, but backend-required
  saves, QA, attestation, feature extraction, and finalization cannot report
  success.
- **Secure Upload Gate**: Local pilot mode uses backend-issued
  `local_private` upload intents only after consent is granted. Production
  private audio/video storage still requires managed signed URLs, encryption,
  retention controls, and audit logs.
- **Backend Boundaries**: `apps/api/` is the canonical lingualens API.
  The experimental audio-to-CHAT implementation remains in
  `src/audio_pipeline/`. `src/therapist_backend/` is retained only as a legacy
  research compatibility API.
- **Human Review Gate**: Generated transcripts require clinician review before preliminary feature outputs or AI-assisted explanation are interpreted.
- **Decision-Support AI Output**: All AI output is strictly designed for screening support (e.g., concern level, review priority, clinician review support) and must never be interpreted as an automated clinical conclusion.
- **Feature-Based ML Review**: lingualens can persist transparent review
  cues only after transcript attestation and feature extraction. The default
  provider is rule-based, outputs are not diagnostic, browser ML fallback is
  disabled, and cues are not inserted into reports automatically. See
  `docs/ML_DECISION_SUPPORT_MODEL_CARD.md`.
- **Gate 1 Status**: The latest reference-evidence artifact passes the
  preregistered engineering gate and is marked `promoted_candidate`. This does
  not activate diagnosis or establish clinical/Thai validation.

### Clinical Validation Limitations
- The project is not clinically validated and must not be used as a standalone clinical tool.
- The current model and demo workflow have not been validated for Thai children.
- ASR-generated transcripts may be inaccurate for children's speech, noisy audio, overlapping speech, or multilingual speech.
- Public datasets and mock records may not represent all populations, languages, care settings, or communication profiles.
- Model and rule-based outputs require human review by qualified professionals before interpretation.

## Maintained Application

### 🩺 Therapist App (`apps/lingualens-app/` + `apps/api/`)

The only active therapist frontend is the Next.js/React/TypeScript app. The
stable path is manual-first: create/open case, create session, upload reviewed
CHA, run QA, attest transcript, extract features, generate AI-assisted
decision-support review, edit/sign off a report, and export only after
therapist sign-off.
Therapists can create a de-identified case from Cases; new cases start with
pending consent and session creation remains locked until the existing consent
verification step is completed.
Signed-off report exports include backend-generated audit metadata: signer,
signed timestamp, report version, and a SHA-256 hash of the signed snapshot.
Edits requested after sign-off create a new draft revision linked to the signed
report, leaving the signed snapshot unchanged for audit.
Transcript edits preserve prior derived records for provenance while marking
existing findings and editable report drafts stale on the backend. Stale
outputs cannot be treated as current, signed off, or exported; the therapist
must regenerate findings and a report from the current transcript version.
LLM/AI report drafting is disabled by default; non-template report providers
require explicit opt-in and record provider/input provenance when requested.
The API also includes an opt-in in-memory rate-limit foundation for local and
pilot hardening; production deployments should replace or front it with managed
edge/API-gateway rate limiting.
CI now runs repository consistency and secret scanning before test/deploy jobs,
with Python and frontend dependency audit steps recorded as production security
gates. Known frontend audit advisories still need remediation before public
production release.
Structured request logging uses route templates or sanitized paths so record
IDs, child identifiers, transcript text, storage keys, and raw file names are
not emitted in normal API logs.
CORS allowed origins are configured by environment variable and production
settings fail closed on wildcard or empty origins. Unsafe browser-origin writes
are guarded by an Origin check in the API.
Production runtime settings also fail closed when demo/default database or Redis
URLs, local repositories, local storage, or in-memory queues are configured;
those credentials must be supplied through a managed secret store.
API migration smoke checks now run in verification/CI, and production backup
restore drills must meet the RPO/RTO in `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_RUNBOOK.md`.
Incident-response stop criteria are documented in
`docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_RUNBOOK.md` for cross-tenant exposure, consent bypass,
audit loss, and fabricated ASR output.
Notification/email safety guards require generic operational messages and block
child identifiers, transcript text, audio/storage keys, raw filenames, and
clinical content.
Audit events include actor, action, target, outcome, timestamp, and correlation
ID, with safety validation to keep clinical content out of audit messages.
Production observability settings fail closed unless an approved provider and
critical alert route are configured. Telemetry events are limited to privacy-safe
operational metadata and must not include child identifiers, transcript text,
audio/storage keys, raw filenames, or clinical content.
Privacy deletion-review requests now carry retention/legal-hold metadata and
retain audit/sign-off evidence; legal hold blocks deletion-review completion.
Production also requires an approved secret-store provider and credential
rotation runbook reference; see `docs/SECRET_ROTATION_RUNBOOK.md`.
For the reduced one-day pilot scope, see
`docs/ONE_DAY_PILOT_SCOPE.md` and `docs/ONE_DAY_PILOT_RUNBOOK.md`. The pilot
adds backend organization/care-team guards and local-private upload intents, but
does not activate production Auth, Supabase Storage, durable workers, legal
review, or clinical validation.
Phase 1 tenant hardening now adds SQL organization settings, membership and
care-team assignment tables, identity/retention/consent/notification/job-attempt
scaffolds, organization-scoped clinical child records, broader backend route
guards, org-admin membership/care-team assignment endpoints, and PostgreSQL RLS
policy SQL as defense-in-depth. This still requires managed Supabase Auth/RLS
verification before production use.
Backend Supabase Auth scaffolding now validates configured HS256 bearer tokens,
requires invitation/MFA/active-membership claims, ignores mock headers in
Supabase mode, and documents the claim contract in
`docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_CONTRACT.md`. Backend Phase 2 workflow endpoints now cover
org-admin invitation records, invitation acceptance into active membership,
membership revocation, and scoped audited break-glass case access. Therapist
App v2 Settings/Admin also exposes a local Pilot Access Lifecycle console for
invitation creation, invitation acceptance into active membership, membership
review, membership revocation, and preparation of an invited `aal1` session to
exercise the MFA gate against the backend admin endpoints; real Supabase
project setup, invitation delivery, custom-claim sync, and staging verification
against real MFA claims are still required.
The production boundary is now frozen around Supabase Auth/Postgres/private
Storage plus FastAPI as the authoritative clinical policy layer. Browser clients
may use Supabase Auth and short-lived signed storage URLs only; clinical
workflow reads/writes go through `apps/api`. lingualens is responsive
web/PWA only, and the removed Vite/Capacitor app must not be recreated.
The maintained `/login` surface is now runtime-aware: mock auth mode still
offers explicit local role/org/AAL simulation, while `supabase` auth mode now
uses a real browser-side `@supabase/supabase-js` client for email/password
sign-in, recovery-email requests, initial session restore, and auth-state
change syncing into the invitation/MFA/org access-state scaffold. Workspace
routes now respect that frontend `supabase` access-state model so
`signed_out`, `aal1`, and ambiguous multi-org states block app content instead
of silently falling back to mock access behavior. In the `aal1` gate, the app
can now start TOTP enrollment, show the QR/secret, and verify the authenticator
code through the Supabase browser client to elevate the session to `aal2`.
Explicit organization selection and org switching also persist back into the
browser auth snapshot so the active organization survives refreshes within the
current session. The frontend API layer now also switches from demo
`X-User-Id` headers to real Supabase bearer tokens plus active-organization
context whenever `supabase` auth mode is active, and protected audio playback
now loads through authenticated blob fetches instead of raw backend file URLs.
The remaining production work is real claim provisioning, invitation delivery,
and staging verification against the actual Supabase projects.
For local multi-org auth simulation, the maintained shell now exposes an
explicit active-organization session switcher; only one organization remains
active per session, and subsequent scoped requests use that selected org.

The canonical therapist path starts from Today or Cases and opens a persisted
session at `/sessions/{sessionId}`. Session Workspace uses the validated
`?view=intake|transcript|findings|report` query contract and defaults safely to
`intake`. Legacy `/record`, `/results`, `/review-transcript`, `/transcript`, and
`/report-summary` URLs redirect into that workspace when they carry a valid
session identifier; identifier-less legacy entry points redirect to
`/cases?intent=start-session`.

The desktop rail and mobile bottom navigation share the same canonical Today,
Cases, Session, Reports, and Settings route model. `/` redirects to `/today`.
Without a safe active session identifier, the Session item opens
`/cases?intent=start-session` rather than constructing an identifier-less
workspace URL. Presentation-only `/demo/*` routes are disabled by default;
local presentation builds must set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`, and enabled
demo pages retain a visible sample-data notice.

Today uses the focused-workbench layout: one prominent Start session action,
one prioritized queue, and a quiet contextual safety/actions surface. The
context moves below the queue when the desktop rail is unavailable rather than
duplicating agenda, result, or action sections across responsive breakpoints.

Cases and Settings are implemented under feature-owned boundaries. Settings
uses a fail-closed role matrix: therapist-facing sections are available to all
authorized clinicians, while `team` and `audit` are organization-admin only.
Unauthorized section requests resolve safely to `profile`, and admin data
effects are not mounted for therapists.
The maintained frontend is aligned to React 19 / Next.js 16 on Node.js 22 so the
Astryx UI packages can be used without peer-version fallbacks. Astryx agent
docs live under `apps/lingualens-app/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and the app imports
`@astryxdesign/core/reset.css`, `@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css`, and
`@astryxdesign/theme-neutral/theme.css` from `src/styles/globals.css`.

```bash
cd apps/api
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

cd ../../apps/lingualens-app
npm ci
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1 npm run dev
```

Cloudflare Workers staging frontend:

```text
https://lingualens-web.monai-yut.workers.dev
```

Deploy the maintained frontend through OpenNext for Cloudflare:

```bash
cd apps/lingualens-app
npm ci
npm run build:cf
npm run deploy:cf
```

When this frontend talks to the Render staging API, include the worker origin in
`THERAPIST_APP_V2_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; otherwise backend-backed auth/API
requests are blocked by browser CORS.

Useful Astryx commands in the therapist app:

```bash
cd apps/lingualens-app
npx astryx build
npx astryx search "dashboard"
npx astryx component Button
```

See `docs/PROFESSOR_DEMO_SCRIPT.md` and
`docs/MVP_VS_EXPERIMENTAL_SCOPE.md` for the walkthrough, scope boundary, and
feature-to-endpoint verification table.

The former `therapist-clinician-app/` Vite/Capacitor surface, removed demo
frontends, and removed benchmark entrypoints are not repository source.
Generated folders from previous local builds may be deleted.

### Assessment v2 Foundation (additive)

The current therapist product and existing clients continue to use `/api/v1`.
The new assessment-centric workflow is exposed additively at `/api/v2` and
supports child, consent, assessment lifecycle, and the Capture V2 slice:
protocol selection, consent-gated activities, private signed uploads, durable
processing runs, worker-owned checksum verification, and basic non-diagnostic
audio quality states. Feature-analysis slices are not mounted yet. The v2
database starts empty: no v1 records, audio, storage keys, or JSON data are
imported or rewritten.

The maintained web app now exposes `/assessments` as the first additive v2
therapist entry point. It covers child selection, consent confirmation,
protocol activities, browser audio capture, private upload handoff, quality
polling, and resuming an existing `ready_for_capture` or `capturing`
assessment. Existing `/api/v1` session screens remain unchanged. Set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSESSMENT_API_BASE_URL` only when the v2 API is hosted at a
different origin; otherwise it is derived from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

The two boundaries are intentionally separate:

```text
LINGUALENS_DATABASE_URL             -> v1 Alembic history -> existing product
LINGUALENS_ASSESSMENT_DATABASE_URL  -> v2 Alembic history -> fresh foundation
```

Supabase Auth establishes identity, FastAPI applies organization, role,
care-team, consent, and workflow policy, and PostgreSQL RLS provides defense in
depth. The v2 service is research decision support only: it does not diagnose
ASD or any developmental condition and does not expose an ASD probability.

For local setup, create the separate database beside the existing v1 database
with `docker compose up -d postgres`, then run the migration checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=apps/api:src python scripts/check_api_migrations.py
PYTHONPATH=apps/api:src python scripts/check_assessment_v2_migrations.py
PYTHONPATH=apps/api:src python scripts/check_assessment_v2_postgres.py
PYTHONPATH=apps/api:src python scripts/check_assessment_v2_compose.py
```

The Compose runtime check creates a disposable PostgreSQL stack, verifies that
the v2 history runs at API startup, confirms the API can create a child through
`/api/v2`, and verifies the runtime role is `NOSUPERUSER`/`NOBYPASSRLS`.

Capture processing is run from durable `processing_runs` records. The capture
worker requires private Supabase Storage configuration for real objects,
`LINGUALENS_CAPTURE_WORKER_ORGANIZATION_IDS` for tenant-scoped PostgreSQL RLS
polling, and `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg` for quality checks; missing media tools produce
an explicit unavailable quality state. Local Compose includes a capture-worker
image with those tools and runs a polling worker with
`python -m app.assessment_v2.worker_runtime` when the `capture-pilot` profile is
enabled. Upload-intent responses expose only a short-lived signed provider URL;
bucket names, object keys, and TUS metadata remain server-side.
Capture V2 treats the database-backed `processing_runs` table as its durable
queue; the legacy Redis queue remains separate and is not part of this worker's
contract. The workflow remains research/education decision support; it does not
diagnose ASD or expose numeric risk.

Clients remain on `/api/v1` until a later migration plan. Rollback is additive:
stop mounting `/api/v2` and disable `LINGUALENS_RUN_ASSESSMENT_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP`;
do not alter the v1 URL or migration history.

## Python ML and Audio Research Layer (`packages/` + `src/`)

Research and reference code for model training, evaluation, audio processing,
and artifact generation. New product API routes belong in `apps/api`, not
`src/therapist_backend`.

### Analysis-only transcript boundary

`packages/analysis_contract/` now defines the small reviewed-transcript analysis
boundary. It uses `packages/cha/` for deterministic semantic CHAT subset
round-trip checks and exposes a versioned, dependency-free Thai/mixed tokenizer
profile, descriptive child-only features, explicit QA blockers/limitations, and
SHA-256 provenance. A synchronous execution seam builds the versioned request,
input checksum, profile, and result envelope without returning transcript
content. This package does not own auth, storage, database access, jobs, product
CRUD, or diagnostic interpretation, and it is not yet connected to a product
API or production worker.

### CLAN-Derived Metrics

The TalkBank/CHILDES reference pipeline can run CLAN batch jobs and parse
completed KIDEVAL output into `data/reference/english_child_clan_features.csv`.
These rows are kept separate from the Python-derived reference features and are
descriptive research artifacts only. The Reference Comparison API can expose
matched CLAN-Derived Metrics in a separate `clan_metric_comparisons` section;
the therapist Transcript tab displays that section separately when backend
Reference Comparison is configured and matched CLAN metrics are available.
The therapist API also exposes `GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/qa` so the
Transcript tab can use backend CHAT/CLAN readiness checks before unlocking
Reference Comparison; mock mode remains a lightweight local QA preview and does
not pretend to validate CLAN readiness.

The reference pipeline also writes
`data/reference/english_child_reference_coverage.csv` and
`docs/REFERENCE_COHORT_COVERAGE.md` to summarize which age/task/group cells are
ready for cautious descriptive comparison and which cells remain low-count. The
current reference snapshot includes 1,961 Python-derived feature rows and 1,961
matched CLAN-Derived Metric rows across the Phase 1 and Phase 2 transcript
intake corpora. Reference feature rows include `age_months_source` and
`age_months_source_detail` so CHAT header ages and official-path fallbacks for
NewEngland/Rescorla remain auditable.

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pipeline (run in order)

```bash
python src/data_loader.py                   # build combined_features.csv + longitudinal_features.csv
python src/eda.py                           # summary stats + plots → reports/figures/
python src/progress_tracking.py            # longitudinal analysis (Rollins + Flusberg)
python -m packages.ml.train_model --features-csv data/combined_features.csv
```

### Key ML Results

Current maintained ML reporting is the reference-evidence Gate 1 pipeline:

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Sensitivity | `0.8862` |
| Sensitivity lower 95% CI | `0.8091` |
| Specificity | `0.6124` |
| ECE | `0.0332` |
| Abstention | `0.3166` |

These are engineering gate metrics for therapist review support only. They are
not clinical validation and must not be presented as diagnosis.

## Features Extracted per `.cha` (14 features)

- **Productivity:** `total_utterances`, `total_words`
- **Complexity:** `mlu` (morphemes), `mluw` (words)
- **Lexical diversity:** `ttr` (type-token ratio)
- **ASD markers:** `unintelligible_count/ratio` (`xxx`/`yyy`), `zero_vocalization_count` (`0 .`), `nonverbal_vocalization_count`, `echolalia_count/ratio`, `pronoun_reversal_count`
- **Pragmatic:** `question_ratio`

---

## Audio Pipeline

End-to-end `.wav` → `.cha` pipeline using Whisper ASR + speaker diarization.

```bash
python -m src.audio_pipeline.pipeline recording.wav \
    --model small --age-months 48 --sex male --group ASD
# → writes recording.cha next to recording.wav
```

**Diarization backends:**
- `EmbeddingDiarizer` (default) — ECAPA-TDNN embeddings, no HF token needed
- `PyannoteDiarizer` (optional) — SOTA, requires `HF_TOKEN`

---

## Research Support Scripts

```bash
python scripts/paper_scout.py --tag speech --tag audio --save   # ASD/AI paper discovery
python scripts/build_zotero_import.py                           # Zotero RIS export
```

See `docs/literature/PAPER_SCOUT.md` for full workflow. Reports saved to `docs/literature/scout_reports/`.

### Build reference-evidence artifacts

Reference evidence is English-only, descriptive, and opt-in. It does not
produce probabilities, predicted classes, rankings, or diagnosis.

```bash
export ML_REFERENCE_PSEUDONYMIZATION_KEY='replace-with-32-or-more-secret-bytes'
python scripts/build_ml_reference_evidence.py \
  --combined data/combined_features.csv \
  --curated data/curated_group_features.csv \
  --output-dir artifacts/reference_evidence/candidate-v1 \
  --artifact-version candidate-v1 \
  --feature-parity-passed
```

Artifact promotion is manual and approval-recorded. See
[`docs/ML_REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/ML_REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_OPERATIONS.md).
